# C - Makefiles

## Project Description

The **C - Makefiles** project is designed to help you understand how to use Makefiles in C programming. Makefiles are essential for automating the build process, making it easier to compile and link C programs with multiple source files. In this project, you'll learn how to:

- Write and structure a Makefile.
- Use `make` to compile C programs efficiently.
- Automate repetitive tasks like compiling object files and linking executables.

The project will give you hands-on experience in managing the build process of a C program and introduce you to best practices in organizing and compiling code with a Makefile.

### Key Features:
- Compilation of multiple C source files.
- Use of object files for efficient compilation.
- Linking of object files to create an executable program.
- Clean-up functionality to remove compiled files.

## Purpose

By completing this project, you'll gain:
- A solid understanding of how Makefiles work.
- The ability to automate and streamline the build process in C projects.
- Knowledge of how to manage dependencies and organize a C project using Makefiles.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge of C programming and automation tools like `make`.
